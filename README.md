# The Impact of Maternal Immunity in Post-Pandemic Disruption of RSV Cases in Young Children

This project explores the impact of maternal immunity on childhood RSV cases, specifically in children up to the age of 4.

The project is structured into 3 main files:
* **Data:** Where all raw data files are kept. This includes data on respiratory virus cases in Scotland and England, mobility data, key lockdown dates and birth data, etc.
* **Code:** Where all the code is kept in subfolders to conduct any exploration (_test_), primary analysis on raw data files (_analysis_), run the RSV model (_model_) and produce figures (_plot_).
* **Output:** Where all the data outputs from the RSV model are stored. Currently, there are subfolders within the _data_ folder to indicate different scenarios and/or factors that have been explored throughout the unfolding of the project.
